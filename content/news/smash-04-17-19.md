We are happy to announce that our next Super Smash Bros. Ultimate fundraiser
tournament will be held next week on Wednesday, April 17th, at 6pm in HCC Room
327. Come out to enjoy thrilling matches and support the club!

As with our last tournament, the entry fee is $5 for tournament + friendlies
access, or $2.50 for just friendlies.

All players are encouraged to bring their own controllers. We will have TVs,
but we welcome participants to bring their full console setups so that we can
have as many matches running simultaneously as possible.
