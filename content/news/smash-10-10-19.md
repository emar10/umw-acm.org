We are proud to host our second Smash Bros tournament / fundraiser of the Fall 2019 semester! This one will be a special event in honor of binary day...a doubles tournament. Find someone you play well with and get ready to have 2v2 action and see which team comes out on top.

Entry is $10 per team, or $2 per person for free play.
The event starts at 5:30PM October 10th.
Location is currently Trinkle Basement but may change. Look for any updates here.
